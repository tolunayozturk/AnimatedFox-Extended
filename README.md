# Custom Modifications to the [AnimatedFox](https://github.com/RemyIsCool/AnimatedFox) theme

This repository contains modifications to the `userChrome.css` file of the original AnimatedFox theme

1. **Window Controls**  
   Adds window control buttons (such as minimize, maximize, and close) back.
   
4. **Bookmark Spacing**  
   Adds a spacing between bookmark toolbar and the navigation bar so the theme can be used with bookmark toolbar enabled. 

5. **Tab Close Buttons**  
   Adds the close button back to individual browser tabs.

6. **Adaptive Navigation Bar**  
   Adjusts the navigation bar spacing based on the visibility of the bookmarks toolbar.
